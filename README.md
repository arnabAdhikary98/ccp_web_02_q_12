# Styling Text with Class Selectors

## Problem Statement

Create a webpage with three paragraphs and apply different styles to each paragraph using class selectors in CSS:

- Assign a class of `highlight` to the first paragraph and style it with a yellow background color and bold text.
- Assign a class of `note` to the second paragraph and style it with italic text and a font color of dark green.
- Leave the third paragraph without a class and apply a default style in CSS to make all paragraphs have a font size of 16px.
